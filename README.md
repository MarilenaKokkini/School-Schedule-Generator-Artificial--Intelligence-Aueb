# SchoolScheduleGenerator
Implemented simulated annealing algorithm that creates a high-shool schedule. The schedule satisfies certain constraints.
A heuristic function was used for evaluation of every schedule that was generated during the process. The algorithm searches the state space that was created and chooses the best possible schedule according to the score that was given by the heuristic function.

Files lessons.txt and teachers.txt consist the program's inputs.
